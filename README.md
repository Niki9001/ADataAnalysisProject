# This is my final project of my DBAS 3090, applied data analytics

## In this project, for predict the downloads, I use online learning. 

## The performance of machine learning doesn't always correlate positively with increasing amounts of data because noise within the data can interfere with the learning process. Therefore, a temporary decline in accuracy over a period can be acceptable, especially for online learning, as long as we can demonstrate that our features have a high relevance to our model, we don't need to constantly change the model.
